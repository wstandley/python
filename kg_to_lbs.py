# Assignment PE1 2.4: Python Variables and Formatting Numbers

# Variables for kilograms
kg_value = 6
kg_value2 = 14
kg_value3 = 38
kg_value4 = 95

# Conversion lb = kg * 2.20462
lb_to_kg = 2.20462

# Calculations
pounds = kg_value * lb_to_kg
pounds2 = kg_value2 * lb_to_kg
pounds3 = kg_value3 * lb_to_kg
pounds4 = kg_value4 * lb_to_kg

# Output Statements
print(f"{kg_value} kilograms is equal to {pounds: .2f} pounds.")
print(f"{kg_value2} kilograms is equal to {pounds2: .2f} pounds.")
print(f"{kg_value3} kilograms is equal to {pounds3: .2f} pounds.")
print(f"{kg_value4} kilograms is equal to {pounds4: .2f} pounds.")
