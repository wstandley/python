    I am going to get the toal dollar value of sales for the week, and the number of sales from the user. Commission is based on dollar value (under 1000, 5%, 1000-2500, 7.5%, over 2500, 10%)
    if they have a lot of low value sales they can still make extra. Every 10 sales gives them a $25 bonus with a maximum of %250.
